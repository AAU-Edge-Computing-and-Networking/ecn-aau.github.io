### What is QUARC about?

Quantum Computers are about to be accessible to the public. The ability for Quantum Computers to break classic
cryptography protocols is pushing the adoption of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). PQC protocols are resistant against
quantum computers.
During 2022, and after several years of research, the first standards on PQC will be made available to the public.
Although the EU has some scattered activities on PQC, it has not yet addressed the need for PQC experts in application
of this emerging technology. This is the driving force for QUARC, a Doctoral Network Industrial Doctorate on PQC,
providing interdisciplinary and integral training and research in PQC. QUARC will train 8 Doctoral Candidates (DCs)
through an outstanding training program that includes coordinated research in different cryptography areas, focusing on
implementation.

QUARC is an industrial doctorate, and besides a 50% of their time located in an industrial partner, each
DC will be also exposed to a set of training initiatives in the areas of relevance for industry and receive the support
of an external advisory board made out of experts in the field. QUARC establishes a well-balances, interdisciplinary,
intersectoral and innovative training network, with an overarching theme of quality and edginess: research as a training
tool to push the current state-of-the-art in PQC.

### Doctoral Candidates
* DC1: Architectural consideration on PQC accelerators based ARM processors
* DC2: Fast computing of PQC ciphers in GPUs on network interface cards
* DC3: Co-integration of quantum communication with PQC key system
* DC4: PQC for resilient communications against quantum computers
* DC5 : Edge computing offloading for PQC communication channels
* DC6: PQC orchestrator for processing distribution
* DC7: PQC cipher architecture, optimization and integration
* DC8: Autonomous offloads in PQC systems
