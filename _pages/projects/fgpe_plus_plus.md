# FGPE++: Gamified Programming Learning at Scale

### Objectives

The proposed project aims at increasing the educational potential of the FGPE framework by enhancing its usability for
both students and teachers, by: (1) enabling the automatic generation of gamified programming exercises, (2) enabling
the effective use of the FGPE programming learning environment on mobile devices which are, for some period,
disconnected from the Internet, (3) developing a full-fledged open online course for a popular programming language.

### Activities

The proposed project consists in four work packages: WP1 (Project Management), WP2 (development of the Programming
Exercise Gamifizer and its promotion), WP3 (development of the Client-side Evaluation Engine and its promotion), and
WP4 (development of the FGPE-supported LMS-compliant gamified programming course and its promotion).

### Impact

The proposed project will produce the following results:

1) Programming Exercise Gamifizer - an open-source software,
2) Client-side Evaluation Engine - an open-source software,
3) a full-fledged FGPE-supported and LMS-compliant open
   gamified course for a popular programming language - an open educational material.
   The project outcomes will include: reducing the requirements in skills for gamifying programming courses and
   improving
   the usability of the FGPE platform.
