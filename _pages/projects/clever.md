# CLEVER: Collaborative edge-cLoud Continuum and Embedded AI for a Visionary Industry of the future

### Objectives

The low latency requested by some industrial applications and the huge amount of data required by AI/ML collected by an
increasing number of sensors is longing for solutions that elaborate the data close to where they are generated.
Solutions elaborating the data in the sensors themselves are emerging for minimizing latency and decreasing capacity
needs (i.e., micro-edge, such as intelligent sensors). These solutions request a comprehensive approach that spans from
processor architectures to middleware to innovative AI applications minimizing costs and power consumption.
CLEVER proposes a series of innovations in hardware accelerators, design stack, and middleware software that
revolutionize the ability of edge computing platforms to operate federatedly, leveraging sparse resources that are
coordinated to create a powerful swarm of resources.

CLEVER technologies will support the deep edge computing paradigm,
moving computing services closer to the end-user or the source of the data to reduce power consumption, capacity
requirements, and latency for mission-critical applications. Furthermore, CLEVER will overcome traditional limitations
of edge computing in terms of limited resource availability by providing an effective framework for the seamless use of
federated resources in the edge-cloud continuum. CLEVER will demonstrate processing solutions for AI at the edge through
four use cases: (1) digital twin for in-factory optimization, (2) smart agriculture for high-yield eco-farms, (3) fully
automated material deployment, and (4) augmented reality for shopping sites. Through the achievement of its goals, the
CLEVER project will help position Europe at the forefront of the intelligent edge computing field, enabling growth
across many sectors (manufacturing, agriculture, smart environments, augmented reality, and others). By lowering the
barriers to utilising edge computing for artificial intelligence applications, CLEVER will open the door for European
Industries and SMEs to leverage state-of-the-art technologies, driving their development and growth as leaders in their
sectors.

### Activities

The CLEVER project is structured into seven Work Packages (WPs) to systematically achieve its objectives. WP1 oversees
project management, ensuring effective administration, financial coordination, technical guidance, and risk management.
WP2 defines the technical and architectural requirements for the CLEVER solution, including detailed KPIs and system
specifications for four key use cases, and outlines how enabling technologies will integrate. This work supports WP3,
which develops innovative hardware accelerators like RISC-V-based processors and communication tools for low-power
environments, along with necessary firmware. WP4 focuses on creating middleware for efficient resource management,
connectivity, and system trustworthiness, supporting both WP3’s hardware and broader edge computing applications. WP5
develops AI-driven applications that leverage the hardware and middleware from WP3 and WP4, focusing on resource
management and optimization. WP6 provides the infrastructure for testing and integrating the technologies from WP3, WP4,
and WP5, validating the overall CLEVER solution against defined KPIs. Finally, WP7 handles the dissemination,
exploitation, and standardization of project results, working alongside WP1 to ensure successful communication and
adoption of the project’s innovations.

### Impact

CLEVER expected impact is multifold. From the scientific viewpoint, CLEVER will contribute to i) consolidating
the knowledge in HW acceleration technologies, advancing state of the art; ii) the adoption of RISC-V and
power-efficient HW, iii) the development of middleware and AI applications for new services exploiting the edge-cloud
continuum iv) to sustain the presence of EU researchers in organize key events in leading conferences in the field; v)
to sustain the development of young researchers’ careers with access to research infrastructures; vi) the further
adoption of open access, good practices in research data management, responsible use of AI/ML and systematic use of open
and standard interfaces.

From the economic viewpoint CLEVER will contribute to i) further consolidating the European position in the industrial
environment, ii) OpEx and CapEx savings; iii) the active exploitation of innovation in HW accelerated systems and
services; iv) the Integration in system vendors and SMEs new products and solutions; v) tangible contributions to market
growth.

From the societal viewpoint, CLEVER will contribute to i) transfer skills, training, and knowledge management in HW
acceleration, middleware, network softwarization, AI/ML; ii) increase support KDT KVIs; iii) contribute to fairness and
digital inclusion; and UN Sustainable Development Goals (sustainable economic growth; resilient infrastructure), low
carbon lifestyles; iv) to implement flexible platforms for services at competitive prices, and v) to enable new
applications such as virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) or the Metaverse.
