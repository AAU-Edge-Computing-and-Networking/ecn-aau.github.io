### Applications for PhD and Postdoc positions
If you are interested in working with us as a PhD student or postdoc, please send an email to one of the [team members]({{ site.baseurl }}/team). State briefly why you are interested and attach a CV, including information about the grades you had as an undergraduate. No need for a separate cover letter or certificates. **Important**: please insert _"Application PhD"_ or _"Application Postdoc"_ in the subject line. If you are applying to a specific advertisement, note this in your email.

We especially welcome postdocs with fellowships. We'd be happy to support you, also after you apply to our group. Take a look at the [Marie Curie Fellowship](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/actions/postdoctoral-fellowships) opportunities. In many countries, there are also fellowships available for outdoing postdocs.**


### Master projects for AAU students
If you are a Master student at AAU looking for a Master project, contact any of the group members per email or stop by our office.

### Bsc / Master students from elsewhere
If you are interested in pursuing a Master degree at AAU in Copenhagen, see [the study programmes available](https://www.en.aau.dk/copenhagen/study-programmes). Sometimes, we take master students or summer interns if we get exceptional applicants (this usually means very good grades and a personal recommendation).
