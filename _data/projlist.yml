- title: "CLEVER: Collaborative edge-cLoud continuum and Embedded AI for a Visionary industry of thE futuRe"
  image: logo_clever.png
  description: CLEVER proposes a series of innovations in hardware accelerators, design stack, and middleware software that revolutionize the ability of edge computing platforms to operate federatedly, leveraging sparse resources that are coordinated to create a powerful swarm of resources. CLEVER technologies will support the deep edge computing paradigm, moving computing services closer to the end user or the source of the data to reduce power consumption, reduce capacity requirements, and latency for mission critical applications. CLEVER will demonstrate processing solutions for AI at the edge through four use cases (1) digital twin for in-factory optimization, (2) smart agriculture for high yield eco-farms, (3) fully automated material deployment, and (4) augmented reality for shopping sites.

- title: "QUARC: Quantum Resistant Communications: Advance Learning in applied PQC Training"
  image: logo_quarc.jpg
  description: QUARC will train 8 Doctoral Candidates (DCs) through an outstanding training program that includes coordinated research in different cryptography areas, focusing on implementation. QUARC is an industrial doctorate, and besides a 50% of their time located in an industrial partner, each DC will be also exposed to a set of training initiatives in the areas of relevance for industry and receive the support of an external advisory board made out of experts in the field. QUARC establishes a well-balances, interdisciplinary, intersectoral and innovative training network, with an overarching theme of quality and edginess - research as a training tool to push the current state-of-the-art in PQC.
