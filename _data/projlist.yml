  image: logo_FGPE.jpg
  description: The project aims at increasing the educational potential of the FGPE framework by enhancing its usability for both students and teachers, by (1) enabling the automatic generation of gamified programming exercises, (2) enabling the effective use of the FGPE programming learning environment on mobile devices which are, for some period, disconnected from the Internet, (3) developing a full-fledged open online course for a popular programming language.
  funding: EU Erasmus+

- title: "CLEVER: Collaborative edge-cLoud continuum and Embedded AI for a Visionary industry of thE futuRe"
  image: logo_clever.png
  description: CLEVER proposes a series of innovations in hardware accelerators, design stack, and middleware software that revolutionize the ability of edge computing platforms to operate federatedly, leveraging sparse resources that are coordinated to create a powerful swarm of resources. CLEVER technologies will support the deep edge computing paradigm, moving computing services closer to the end user or the source of the data to reduce power consumption, reduce capacity requirements, and latency for mission critical applications. Furthermore, CLEVER will overcome traditional limitations of edge computing in terms of limited resource availability by providing an effective framework for seamless use of federated resources in the edge-cloud continuum. CLEVER will demonstrate processing solutions for AI at the edge through four use cases (1) digital twin for in-factory optimization, (2) smart agriculture for high yield eco-farms, (3) fully automated material deployment, and (4) augmented reality for shopping sites. Through the achievement of its goals, the CLEVER project will help to position Europe at the forefront of the intelligent edge computing field, enabling growth across many sectors (manufacturing, agriculture, smart environments, augmented reality, and others). By lowering the barriers for utilising edge computing for artificial intelligence applications, CLEVER will open the door for European Industries and SMEs to leverage state of the art technologies, driving their development and growth as leaders in their sectors.
